    **"Live the World You Imagine"**

Welcome to the digital home of ZuhaWorld Green Heaven. This project is a curated fusion of photography, storytelling, and social advocacy, documented through my lens as I explore the landscapes and cultural heritage of Bangladesh.

## 🚀 Mission
Guided by the philosophy that **"One can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone,"** this platform serves two purposes:
1. **Visual Documentation:** Capturing the diverse beauty and environmental narratives of Bangladesh.
2. **Social Impact:** Highlighting the initiatives led by **ZuhaWorld Social Impact** to create sustainable change through technology and community engagement.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
As a developer-led project, the site is built with a focus on performance and clean code:
- **Frontend:** Semantic HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Grid & Flexbox layouts)
- **Dynamic Content:** Vanilla JavaScript for the JSON-based blog system.
- **Integrations:** Formspree API for serverless contact handling.
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `index.html`: The gateway featuring our hero mission and photography gallery.
- `about.html`: Insights into my journey as a developer, writer, and CEO.
- `impact.html`: Dedicated showcase of ZuhaWorld Social Impact projects.
- `script.js`: The "engine" that handles dynamic blog post injection.
- `style.css`: Custom "Green Heaven" design system.
